Shortcut commands:

Sorry, there’re no shortcut commands at this point, but you can visit each file and run the function that ends with Page() to see what that page looks like. Keep in mind that any buttons in such-loaded pages wouldn’t work, as it is not connected to other files. 
If you’d like the buttons and the main game to work, please run ‘MazeRunnerPlay.py’ and click the respective buttons you’d like to see functioning.
